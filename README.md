# Server-Client Assignment
Python program designed for message exchange between a client and a server.

Server Implementation: The server functionality is built upon the Flask framework. It establishes an API endpoint accessible at /api/messages. 
This endpoint is employed to facilitate the exchange of messages between clients and the server.

Client Implementation: The client aspect of the code utilizes the requests library. 
This library empowers the client to dispatch messages to the server. 
This is the process of sending and receiving messages between the client and the server.
